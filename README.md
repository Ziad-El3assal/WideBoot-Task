  This is WideBot – AI assignment for Data Scientist intern

## Task 1 - Spelling Checker
Using this dictionary, implement a spell checker class that takes this dictionary as input, this
class has three main operations:
• Store this dictionary in a suitable data structure.
• Take an input word and return the nearest 4 words if this word is not in the dictionary
• Take an input word and add this word to the dictionary
For each operation specify the time and space complexity
Note: You could assume that the nearest 4 words from a word are the 2 words before and
after this word in lexicographic order if they exist.
## Task 2 - EDA
Using this dataset, you are supposed to prepare an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report
in PDF format that shows at least 3 different insights about this data (number of examples
per class, top frequent n-grams generally and per class, lengths of examples in words and
letters, ….) . Feel free to show your insights in a good format (description, tables, charts,
…).
Note that you can prepare the PDF manually after generating the analytics in any other
format (CSV, xls, doc), …).
Note: Use stories data only (not comments).
## Task 3 - Classification
Using the same data in task 2, build a machine learning based classifier and show its
performance on the test-set. Show precision, recall, f-score, accuracy for each class and for
the whole test data. Please describe briefly the meaning of each result and metric for this
specific task. Also, please write some enhancements that you may think about to achieve
better results.
Note: add a readme file that describes the whole training process in briefed points. Note:
Use stories data only (not comments). Also, take the last 20% of each file as a test-set.
